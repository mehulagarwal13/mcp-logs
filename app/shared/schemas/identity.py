"""The `Identity` value object threaded through every cross-module call.

Owned by: shared/ (ARCHITECTURE.md section 3). This is the single most
load-bearing shared type in the system: API_DESIGN.md section 2 threads
`Identity` through every `core/` and `agents/` public call precisely so that
access control is identical regardless of entry point -- the same
`authorize()` check runs whether a request arrived over REST or MCP
(ARCHITECTURE.md section 6).

It is deliberately transport-agnostic: it carries *who* the caller is and
*what* they're allowed to do, with no knowledge of JWTs, MCP tokens, or HTTP.
Resolving a raw credential into an `Identity` is core/auth/'s job; everything
downstream just receives the resolved object.

Multi-tenancy (PROJECT_PLAN.md section 3.4-3.6): an `Identity` is scoped to
exactly one organization -- there is no global, org-less identity in this
system. `organization_id` is the claim every session token carries (section
3.4) and the value every downstream query filters by (section 3.7); making it
a required field here, rather than an optional add-on, is what makes
"resolve this user's identity" and "resolve this user's identity within this
organization" the same operation -- there is no other kind to accidentally
fall back to.

`project_permissions` is the extension point for the second, finer-grained
authorization tier (section 3.6): a project-scoped role can override the
identity's org-level `permissions` for a specific project. It defaults to
empty here -- no code path populates it yet (project-level authorization is
not implemented as of this change; see core/users/service.py's docstring) --
but the field is part of the target `Identity` shape per PROJECT_PLAN.md, so
`has_permission`/`authorize` already support it and adding real project-scoped
resolution later is additive, not another breaking change to this schema.
