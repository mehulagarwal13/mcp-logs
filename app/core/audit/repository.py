"""Persistence for core/audit -- the only module that writes `audit_logs`.

Owned by: core/audit. Pure data access: functions here take an AsyncSession,
issue exactly one statement, and return ORM rows (or None). They never commit,
never map to Pydantic, and never enforce business rules -- that is the
service's job (ARCHITECTURE.md section 3: infrastructure/persistence holds no
business logic).

Append-only by contract (DATABASE_DESIGN.md): this module exposes only INSERT
and SELECT. No update/delete function exists, so the append-only guarantee is
structural, not merely a convention someone must remember.
