"""Domain error types raised by the core/ service layer.

Owned by: core/. These are transport-agnostic: a service raises `NotFoundError` or `PermissionDeniedError` without knowing whether the caller arrived over REST or MCP. The api/ and mcp/ boundary layers each catch `EKIPError` and translate `.error_code` / `.status_hint` into their own protocol -- an HTTP status code, or an MCP error response -- so REST and MCP share one set of error semantics (ARCHITECTURE.md section 6).

Why a small explicit hierarchy rather than raising built-ins (ValueError, KeyError): the boundary layer needs a stable, machine-readable `error_code` and a status mapping that does not depend on guessing from a built-in type. Keeping the mapping on the exception (via `status_hint`) means the transport layer stays a thin translation with no per-error `if isinstance(...)` ladder.
