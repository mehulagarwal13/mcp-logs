"""Persistence for core/incidents -- incidents, incident timeline, postmortems.

Owned by: core/incidents. Pure data access, same discipline as every other
repository.py in this codebase: one statement per function, ORM rows in/out,
no business rules, no ORM->Pydantic mapping.

`update_incident`/`update_postmortem` are generic, dict-driven field updaters
(taking `**fields`) rather than one narrowly-named function per field
(contrast `core/tenancy/repository.py`'s `update_connector_config_sync_status`):
incidents and postmortems have enough independently-updatable fields that a
narrow function per field would multiply faster than it's worth, and the
service layer already computes exactly which fields changed via
`model_dump(exclude_unset=True)`, so handing that dict straight through here
is the more DRY choice. `**fields: Any` is a deliberate, narrow exception to
this project's strict mypy config -- these two functions are intentionally
generic/dynamic.
