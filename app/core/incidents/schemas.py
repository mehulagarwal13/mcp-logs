"""Pydantic contracts for core/incidents.

Owned by: core/incidents. Local to this submodule except where a type is
reused verbatim from shared/schemas/ (API_DESIGN.md "Design conventions":
defined once, reused everywhere -- `Severity`, `IncidentStatus`,
`PostmortemStatus`, `ActionItemStatus` already exist there and are imported,
not redefined, here).

core/incidents owns BOTH `incidents` and `postmortems` (PROJECT_PLAN.md
section 9.4: "the incident and postmortem system of record") -- not two
separate submodules, matching DATABASE_DESIGN.md's original table-ownership
grouping.

`Incident`/`Postmortem` carry `organization_id` (and `Incident`/`Postmortem`
also `project_id`/`incident_id` respectively) per PROJECT_PLAN.md section
3.2 -- this was already true of the underlying ORM models
(`database/models/core_models.py`) before this file existed; these schemas
just expose it.
